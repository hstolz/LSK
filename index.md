# Description | Elevator Pitch
Almost everyone has gone through the process of learning a second language and knows that oral fluency and is one of the hardest aspects of language mastery. Despite all the time put into reading books and studying up a language, when it comes to developing oral skills, there is absolutely nothing better than face to face conversation. However, a majority of the time, opportunities for face-to-face practice are scarce. Other language learning applications focus on developing vocabulary or connecting people from across the globe, but most do not focus on in person, face-to-face interaction. The goal of **WordUp** is to connect students around campus and to facilitate in-person meetings to bring your language abilities to the next level.
