# WordUp
#### The Language Learning Facilitator

# Description
Almost everyone has gone through the process of learning a second language and knows that oral fluency is one of the most difficult aspects of language mastery. Despite all the time put into reading books and studying up on a language, when it comes to developing oral skills, there is absolutely nothing better than face-to-face conversation. However, a majority of the time, opportunities for this type of practice are scarce. Other language-learning applications focus on developing vocabulary or connecting people from across the globe, but most do not focus on in-person interactions. The goal of  **WordUp** is to connect students within the multilingual environment that is a college campus and to facilitate meetups to bring your language abilities to the next level.
